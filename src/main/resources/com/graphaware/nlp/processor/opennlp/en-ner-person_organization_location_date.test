<START:person> Theresa May <END> has said she will form a government with the support of the <START:organization> Democratic Unionists <END> that can provide "certainty" for the future.
Speaking after visiting <START:location> Buckingham Palace <END> , she said only her party had the "legitimacy" to govern after winning the most seats and votes.
In a short statement outside <START:location> Downing Street <END> , which followed a 25-minute audience with <START:person> The Queen <END> , Mrs <START:person> May <END> said she intended to form a government which could "provide certainty and lead <START:location> Britain <END> forward at this critical time for our country".

The <START:organization> BBC's <END> <START:person> Laura Kuenssberg <END> said the PM had returned to No 10 a "diminished figure", having ended up with 12 fewer seats than when she called the election in <START:date> April <END> .
She had called the election with the stated reason that it would strengthen her hand in negotiations for the <START:location> UK <END> to leave the <START:location> EU <END> - the talks are due to start on <START:date> 19 June <END> .

The general election has ended in a hung <START:organization> Parliament <END> , where no party has the 326 seats needed to get an overall majority in the <START:location> House of Commons <END> .
So what happens now?
Who is the prime minister?
 <START:person> Theresa May <END> remains prime minister.
She aims to form a minority government, working with the <START:organization> Democratic Unionist Party <END> .

The <START:organization> Labour <END> leader does not have to wait until Mrs <START:person> May <END> has exhausted all her options before he starts trying to put a deal of his own together.
He can hold talks with potential partners at the same time as Mrs <START:person> May <END> .
They may even be talking to the same people.

Labour had a majority of three after the <START:date> 1974 <END> general election - but this had vanished by <START:date> 1977 <END> , and it stayed in power thanks to a "pact" with the <START:organization> Liberal Party <END> .
And <START:person> John Major's <END> Conservative government started out with a majority of 21 in <START:date> 1992 <END> but was a minority government by the <START:date> 1997 <END> general election.

On <START:date> 8 May 2013 <END> , one week before the <START:location> Pakistani <END> election, the third author, in his keynote address at the <START:organization> Sentiment Analysis Symposium <END> , forecast the winner of the <START:location> Pakistani <END> election.
The chart in Figure 1 shows varying sentiment on the candidates for prime minister of <START:location> Pakistan <END> in that election.
The next day, the <START:organization> BBC’s <END> <START:person> Owen Bennett Jones <END> , reporting from <START:location> Islamabad <END> , wrote an article titled “ <START:location> Pakistan <END> Elections: Five Reasons Why the Vote is Unpredictable.”

At the moment the first deadline is <START:date> Tuesday <END> <START:date> 13 June <END> , when the new <START:organization> Parliament <END> meets for the first time.
 Mrs <START:person> May <END> has until this date to put together a deal to keep herself in power or resign, according to official guidance issued by the <START:organization> Cabinet Office <END> .
If she were to resign, Mrs <START:person> May <END> must be clear that <START:person> Jeremy Corbyn <END> can form a government and that she can't.
She is entitled to wait until the new <START:organization> Parliament <END> to see if she has the confidence of the <START:organization> House of Commons <END> .

 <START:location> Japan's <END> parliament has passed a one-off bill to allow Emperor <START:person> Akihito <END> to abdicate, the first emperor to do so in 200 years.
The 83-year-old said last year that his age and health were making it hard for him to fulfil his official duties.
But there was no provision under existing law for him to stand down.
The government will now begin the process of arranging his abdication, expected to happen in late <START:date> 2018 <END> , and the handover to <START:person> Crown Prince Naruhito <END> .

 <START:location> Germany <END> has called for diplomatic efforts to resolve a growing crisis over <START:location> Qatar <END> , which is accused by four Arab neighbours of funding terrorism.
<START:location> Saudi Arabia <END> , the <START:location> United Arab Emirates <END> ( <START:location> UAE <END> ), <START:location> Egypt <END> and <START:location> Bahrain <END> cut travel and diplomatic ties with <START:location> Qatar <END> on <START:date> Monday <END> .
Speaking after hosting his Qatari counterpart on <START:date> Friday <END> , <START:location> German <END> Foreign Minister <START:person> Sigmar Gabriel <END> called for the "sea and air blockades" to be lifted.

Mr <START:person> Gabriel <END> met Saudi Foreign Minister <START:person> Adil al-Ahmad al-Jubayr <END> <START:date> two days ago <END> , and said all parties were seeking "to avoid further escalation".
Then on <START:date> Friday <END> , Mr <START:person> Gabriel <END> spoke to Qatari Foreign Minister <START:person> Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani <END> in the northern German town of <START:location> Wolfenbuettel <END> .

On <START:date> Friday <END> <START:location> Saudi Arabia <END> and its three allies issued a list of 49 people - including <START:organization> Muslim Brotherhood <END> spiritual leader <START:person> Yusuf al-Qaradawi <END> - and 12 Qatar-backed charities and groups accused of links with militants.
On <START:date> Thursday <END> , Qatar's <START:person> Sheikh Mohammed <END> said his country had been isolated "because we are successful and progressive" and called his country "a platform for peace not terrorism".

<START:location> US <END> President <START:person> Donald Trump <END> has urged <START:organization> Nato <END> allies to boost defence spending.
Last month German Chancellor <START:person> Angela Merkel <END> said <START:location> Europe <END> could no longer "completely depend" on the <START:location> US <END> and <START:location> UK <END> , following the election of President <START:person> Trump <END> and the triggering of Brexit.

The <START:location> UK <END> has long been one of the strongest voices in the <START:location> EU <END> against any moves towards forming a <START:organization> European army <END> .
The <START:location> UK <END> says the <START:location> EU <END> must not duplicate <START:organization> Nato's <END> role as the main pillar of European defence.
However, Mr <START:person> Trump's <END> criticisms of <START:organization> Nato <END> have raised questions about the US commitment to defending <START:location> Europe <END> .

The <START:organization> Cabinet Office <END> revealed on <START:date> Wednesday <END> that <START:location> Japan's <END> GDP grew by 0.3% during the <START:date> first quarter of 2017 <END> .
Although the reading missed a forecast of 0.6% growth, <START:location> Japan's <END> economy continued to expand in five consecutive quarters, the country's highest streak in three years.

The General Administration of Customs revealed on <START:date> Thursday <END> that <START:location> China's <END> exports increased by 8.7% year-on-year in <START:date> May <END> , beating forecasts of a 7.2% increase.
The country's trade surplus now amounts to $40.8bn (£31bn).

Furthermore, the <START:organization> European Central Bank <END> is scheduled to hold its monetary policy meeting today as well.
Expectations point towards the <START:organization> Bank <END> reaffirming its decision to maintain a loose monetary policy, but spectators will carefully scrutinize <START:organization> ECB <END> President <START:person> Mario Draghi <END> and his team's rhetoric in order to get an indication of when interest rates could possibly rise.

<START:person> James Trescothick <END> , senior global strategist, said there is the potential that <START:organization> Opec's <END> agreement to limit current oil production could collapse.
If that happens oil prices could potentially fall.
However, <START:location> Qatar <END> is one of the smallest oil producers in <START:organization> Opec <END> , with estimated proven reserves of 25bn barrels which is dwarfed by <START:location> Saudi Arabia's <END> 266bn barrels.
<START:person> Trescothick <END> believes the main danger to the region and indeed to oil prices is that increased tension could lead <START:location> Qatar <END> to reach out even further to <START:location> Iran <END> for support which would no doubt sour diplomatic relations further.
